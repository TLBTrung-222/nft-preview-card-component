## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Position
- Transform

### What I learned

- How to center an img inside an img
```css
.pro-img-container .view-img {
    /* Center the view image inside the product image */
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

- Create a background for the img : Add the div inside the container and set position absolute to that div => div will overlap the image
